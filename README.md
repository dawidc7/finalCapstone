# Sentiment Analysis

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on a data set of amazon product reviews.

It reads them from a csv file and proceeds to predict the sentiment of individual sample reviews as well as multiple reviews and totals them up.

## Installation
To install, download this code and paste it into a python interpreter.
You also need to download **NLTK**, **Spacy**, **Pandas** and the language model **"en_core_web_md"**.
Furthermore, download the corresponding file **amazon_product_reviews.csv** and make sure the script and the csv are _in the same folder_.
## How to run
In your python interpreter, navigate to the folder where the python script and csv are. This can be done by using the terminal in the interpreter.
By default, the code will run `get_user_choice()`, which will prompt the user to make a choice. Simply make a choice and the code will run.
